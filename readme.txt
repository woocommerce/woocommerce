== Description ==

WooCommerce is a flexible, open-source eCommerce solution built on WordPress. Whether you're launching a business, taking an existing brick and mortar store online, or designing sites for clients you can get started quickly and build exactly the store you want.

Activate the free WooCommerce plugin on a new or existing WordPress site, follow the optional guided tour, and set up a new store in minutes with:

- Product, Cart, and Checkout pages
- Secure payments by credit card and alternatives
- Configurable shipping options, including flat rates and [label printing](https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6)
- Integrate content and commerce across your site via modular blocks
- [Automated tax calculations](https://woocommerce.com/products/tax/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6)
- [Google Analytics](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-google-analytics/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), [MailChimp](https://woocommerce.com/products/mailchimp-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), and [Facebook](https://woocommerce.com/products/facebook/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) integration
- [Central store dashboard](https://woocommerce.com/posts/woocommerce-admin-a-new-central-dashboard-for-woocommerce/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) with key metrics, and more.

Beyond the basics, WooCommerce is fully customizable and extendable:

- Choose a design to suit your brand and industry.
- Enhance your store with free and paid extensions: add features and integrate with local and global eCommerce web services.
- Inspect and modify any aspect of the core plugin code.
- Leverage hooks and filters to modify functions.
- Build on top of the REST API and webhooks.

Open-source freedoms mean full ownership of content and data forever – plus the expertise of a friendly [global community](https://woocommerce.com/meetups/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6).

WooCommerce is built to allow store managers to run an eCommerce site themselves, no web developer needed. There is also a free WooCommerce [mobile app](https://woocommerce.com/mobile/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) (Android and iOS) for store management on the go. 

WooCommerce is developed and supported by Automattic, the creators of Jetpack and WordPress.com, along with independent contributors. The [official extension marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) is on WooCommerce.com.

= From subscriptions to gym classes to luxury cars =
With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, complex configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers; and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.

And those are just the out-of-the-box options. With paid extensions, you can extend your WooCommerce store to take bookings, offer memberships, set up recurring payments by subscription, create dynamic pricing rules, and much more.

Start a monthly wine subscription box, offer a discount on yoga mats to members who’ve attended 10+ classes, offer configurable hampers or personalized jewelry – it’s all possible with WooCommerce.

= Comprehensive payment options =
WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, alternative payment methods, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. 

For additional options, WooCommerce also integrates with more than 140 region-specific gateways including popular choices like [Stripe](https://woocommerce.com/products/stripe/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), [PayPal](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-gateway-paypal-checkout/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), [Square](https://woocommerce.com/products/square/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) and [Amazon Pay](https://woocommerce.com/products/pay-with-amazon/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6). [Apple Pay](https://woocommerce.com/apple-pay/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) and Google Pay are also supported.

Search for your payment service provider of choice on the [official marketplace](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6).

= Ship locally and globally =
Shipping with WooCommerce is highly configurable. Adjust the built-in settings to offer free shipping or flat rate shipping, limit your shipments to specific countries by setting up shipping zones, or open your store up to the world. 

Official extensions connect you with hundreds of local and international carriers – including [Royal Mail](https://woocommerce.com/products/royal-mail/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), [FedEx](https://woocommerce.com/products/fedex-shipping-module/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6), and [Australia Post](https://woocommerce.com/products/australia-post-shipping-method/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) – and let you integrate with [inventory management and fulfilment providers](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-methods/inventory-fulfillment/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6).

There are also extensions available to add [delivery and shipping options](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/shipping-methods/delivery-shipping-options/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) and support strategies like buy-one-get-one free, free gifts, and add-ons. [WooCommerce Shipping](https://woocommerce.com/products/shipping/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) supports real-time calculations and printing labels at home.  

= Design your store with themes and blocks =

WooCommerce store design starts with a theme of your choice. There are hundreds of free and paid themes available, including [Storefront](https://woocommerce.com/storefront/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) by Automattic -- it's free to all stores and you can choose to have it installed for you during the guided setup. 

Storefront offers deep WooCommerce integration and prioritizes speed and uptime. You can add your brand and define your style by customizing Storefront yourself or adding one of several industry-themed [Storefront child themes](https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6). 

Personalize your store's design even more with WooCommerce Blocks (available in WooCommerce 3.6 and above) -- use them to add selections of or single products to any page, for a seamless blending of commerce into content.

= Customize your store with extensions =

There are hundreds of official extensions reviewed by WooCommerce developers available on the WooCommerce.com marketplace, and many in the WordPress.org repository and on the wider web. 

= Control your data forever =

WooCommerce gives you complete control – from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your store’s design, and switch themes or hosts or payment service providers, all as you please. 

In a world increasingly aware of the importance of data protection, WooCommerce gives you full ownership over what is tracked and stored. If you opt to share [usage data](https://woocommerce.com/usage-tracking/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) with us, your data is anonymized and kept secure. At any stage, you can opt out of all forms of tracking while still enjoying all of WooCommerce's capabilities. 

With WooCommerce, your data belongs to you. One of the risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform the risk of losing your store if the provider closes. WooCommerce store data is future-proof -- you’re are free to export all your content and take your site  wherever you choose.

= Why developers like WooCommerce =

WooCommerce was originally created with developers in mind. Built with a REST API, it integrates with virtually any service. Store data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. 

WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and scale a store that meets client’s specifications, and to make enhancements either with extensions or with customs solution.

No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce has a robust framework that supports stores from basic to enterprise – with content and commerce in a single, central location.

WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers who work across time zones to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs. There is comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation that is updated with each release. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the site your client needs.

= Join our growing community =

WooCommerce is one of the fastest-growing eCommerce communities. We’re proud that the helpfulness of the community and wealth of resources available online are frequently cited as reasons our users love it.

There are 80+ [WooCommerce Meetups](https://woocommerce.com/woocommerce/meetups/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) taking place in cities across the world that you can attend for free and even get involved in running. WooCommerce also has a regular presence at WordCamps across the globe – and we’d love to meet you.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* PHP 7.2 or greater is recommended
* MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

Visit the [WooCommerce server requirements documentation](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/server-requirements/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) for a detailed list of server requirements.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handles the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”
 
In the search field type “WooCommerce,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us,  you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by! Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation method requires downloading the WooCommerce plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting “Save.” That should return things to normal.

= Sample data =

WooCommerce comes with some sample data you can use to see how products look; import sample_products.xml via the [WordPress importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-importer/). You can also use the core [CSV importer](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/product-csv-importer-exporter/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) or our [CSV Import Suite extension](https://woocommerce.com/products/product-csv-import-suite/?utm_source=wp%20org%20repo%20listing&utm_content=3.6) to import sample_products.csv
