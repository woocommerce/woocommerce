## API & Reference Docs

The resources below contain low-level documentation about features, libraries, extensions, and other pieces of WooCommerce architecture. Use them as a reference when building extensions or integrating with WooCommerce.

## [REST API](https://woocommerce.github.io/woocommerce-rest-api-docs/)

The WooCommerce REST API lets you create, read, update, and delete WooCommerce data using HTTP requests, so you can integrate external applications with WooCommerce and build extensions that make use of asynchronous UI frameworks such as React.

### [Core API](https://woo.com/wc-apidocs/index.html)

The WooCommerce Core API code reference contains information about packages and classes that make up WooCommerce's core functionality.

### [Store API](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/tree/trunk/src/StoreApi)

The Store API provides public Rest API endpoints for the development of customer-facing cart, checkout, and product functionality. It follows many of the patterns used in the [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/key-concepts/).
