A bug or a missing feature can be a showstopper for merchants. Bugs that pile up or popular features that are not implemented can lead to negative reviews and/or merchants churning and looking at a competitive solution.

Bugs are usually reported via support or GitHub, or you can discover them yourselves in testing.

When a critical bug is found, resolve it within a couple of days (most critical bugs should be resolved within 24 hours) and release a new plugin version promptly. Part of your release process should be to notify all stakeholders (the support team and the merchant affected) about the upcoming release.

Even though a critical bug is a great source of stress for merchants, a quick resolution makes merchants feel heard and supported - having a reliable business partner, who is keen to help in the most difficult situation, helps build a stronger relationship. Therefore, we usually ask merchants for a 5* review when we deliver a fast solution.

When you implement a new feature request and ship a new plugin version, you can follow a similar approach to bugs:

* Notify all stakeholders.
* Update the relevant request in the Feature Requests board, by sharing a public update and marking it as 'Completed'.
* For breaking releases: communicating with your marketing/relations teams to publish updates/newsletters before the release.
