You can request to have reviews that are not actually feedback removed. Where this might be applicable is if the request is a simple support request, where it's obviously in the wrong spot. 1 star reviews, even if aggressive or angry, are not usually removed.

Reply to reviews! Thank the giver for offering feedback, acknowledge the issue if needed, ask for more specific feedback, or provide an update when that feedback is addressed! Your reviews are a great window into what your extension's users are actually thinking.

Having folks close to the extension's development (think developers and project managers) looking at reviews on a regular basis is a good way to ensure the customers voice is heard. 1 star reviews are among the most useful, as long as the issue is understood and addressed (if needed).
