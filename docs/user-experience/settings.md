Settings should focus on creating an accessible and intuitive interface for customizing the plugin's features. The goal is to design settings that are easily navigable, understandable, and efficient, allowing users to tailor the plugin's functionalities to their specific needs and preferences. A well-designed settings interface significantly enhances the overall usability and satisfaction of the plugin.

## Best Practices

**Make extension settings easy to understand.** Only include settings options that are crucial to the overall functionality of the product.

**Use smart defaults wherever possible**, rather than asking the merchant to configure.

**Group your settings intuitively.** Prioritize frequently-used settings at the top of each section, and place destructive or infrequently-used settings at the bottom.

**Group relevant settings together**, either by frequency of use (eg. Quick Settings), or by description (eg. Account Settings). Use section titles and sub-section titles to create clear hierarchy.

**Avoid long, tedious lists of many different types of settings.** This overwhelms the user with so many options that the product feels unusable to them. Consider using separate pages or sections for different types of settings, or progressive disclosure that surfaces the most used settings and hides everything else.

**Use impersonal titles and text**, eg. “Reports” instead of “My reports.” Exception: If referring to the user is necessary for understanding the setting, use the second person (“you”) rather than the first person (“I”).

**Include helper text** for settings or sections that are not easily understandable.

**Use clear and consistent language.** Avoid technical jargon.
