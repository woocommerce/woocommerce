Subsections add extra fields to existing form groups. They are small forms with a low to medium level of complexity. This interface location works best for extensions that add extra features that build off an existing Woo functionality.

## What they are for

- Relevant features that can be crucial to merchants' product creation flow
- 2-5 field forms with simple functionality, e.g., dimensions or tax settings
- Lists of items, e.g., attachments, channels, or accounts

## What they aren't for

- Simple extensions with 1-2 fields
- Multi-step forms and complex tables
- Read-only descriptions, setup guides, and advertisements

## Example

If you're developing an extension that allows merchants to upload 360 images or videos, you could add it as a field or a button in the Images section in the General tab. This way, merchants can create the perfect product gallery without jumping between multiple tabs.

## Other use cases include

- Adding extra product details, e.g., measurements under Shipping
- Setting up social channels in the Visibility section in the General tab
- Changing the VAT tax settings in the Pricing tab
