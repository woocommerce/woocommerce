- Small: Height 40px
- Default: Height 48px
- Large: Height 56

### Anatomy

Payment buttons consist of up to three elements: a button component, payment logo, and optional label.

### Layout and spacing

The spacing between and around the Label and Payment Logo adapts based on the size of the button.
