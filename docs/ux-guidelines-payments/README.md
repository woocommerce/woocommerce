When building payments extensions, you should ensure you follow the [WooCommerce Extension Guidelines](./user-experience-guidelines).

Payments plugins come in many types: payment processors and gateways, wallets, Buy Now Pay Later, crypto, and more.

The choice between payment plugins depends on the specific needs and preferences of the merchant and their customers. Some merchants may choose to use multiple types of payment plugins to offer their customers a wider range of payment options.

A merchant can discover a payments plugin in the following ways:

- Through direct installation from WordPress plugins.
- Through Woo's public list of payment services on the Marketplace.
- Through the admin onboarding tasks and payments settings. To be added to the list of payment gateways in the Woo admin, the payments plugin must meet the criteria listed in these guidelines.
