For those who prefer to programmatically disable marketplace suggestions that are fetched from woocommerce.com, add the `woocommerce_allow_marketplace_suggestions` filter to your theme’s `functions.php` or a custom plugin. 

For example: 

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_allow_marketplace_suggestions', '__return_false' );
```

This filter will completely remove Marketplace Suggestions from your WooCommerce admin.
