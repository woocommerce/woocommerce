This section covers general guidelines and best practices to follow in order to ensure your theme experience aligns with ecommerce industry standards and WooCommerce for providing a great online shopping experience, maximizing sales, ensuring ease of use, seamless integration, and strong UX adoption.

We recommend you review the [UI best practices for WordPress](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices/) to ensure your theme is aligned with the WordPress theme requirements.

Make sure your theme fits one or more industries currently available in the [WooCommerce themes store](woocommerce.com/product-category/themes). It's important that the theme offers enough originality and distinctiveness in its design, while keeping it familiar, in order to be distinguished from other themes on the WooCommerce theme store. Your theme should avoid copying existing themes on the WooCommerce theme store or other WordPress theme marketplaces.
