# Coupons Report

WooCommerce 4.0 (and the WooCommerce Admin plugin) includes a new `Analytics` top level menu. The `Coupons` report is under the `Analytics` menu.

If you have a store with existing Orders, you should [Import your Historical Data](analytics-historical-data-import.md)

### Coupon Filters

When the Coupon report loads it includes all coupons for the selected date range. The Coupon filter dropdown has two filter options:

For either filter, begin typing the name of the coupon. While you are typing the name of the coupon the filter will lookup coupon names that contain the string you have entered. 

#### Single Coupon

This filter loads the report for the coupon you have selected.
