### Advanced Filters

The advanced filters allow adding multiple filters to the report. These filters can be applied in two ways:

- All - Variations must match all filters to be included in the report
- Any - Variations must match one or more filters to be included in the report

### Report Columns

The report table contains the following columns:

- Variation title - links to Edit Product screen
- SKU
- Items sold (count)
- Net sales
- Orders (count) - links to Orders Report filtered by Variation
- Status (in/out stock)
- Stock (inventory quantity)

### Report Sorting

The report table allows sorting by the following columns:

- SKU
- Items sold (count)
- Net sales
- Orders (count)

By default, the report sorts Variations by most items sold.

#### Clarifying Terms

"Net sales" is calculated by subtracting refunds and coupons from the sale price of the variation(s).

As an equation, it might look like: `(variation price * quantity) - refunds - coupons`.
