== Description ==

WooCommerce Admin is a new JavaScript-driven interface for managing your store. The plugin includes new and improved reports and a dashboard to monitor key metrics of your site.

**Do I need this plugin?**

This is a [feature plugin](https://woocommerce.com/document/what-is-a-woocommerce-feature-plugin/) for testing the latest features, such as Analytics, for future versions of WooCommerce. A stable version of this plugin is packaged with WooCommerce since version 4.0, so you don't need to install this plugin for analytics in your WooCommerce store.

Install this plugin if you want to test new features before they are released in WooCommerce. If you have trouble, let us know in the [Support Forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-admin/) and participate in its development on the public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-admin).

**New Reports for WooCommerce**

WooCommerce Admin has a host of new reports that are optimized for speed and have advanced filters that allow you to dive into data about your store:

- Revenue Report
- Orders Report
- Products Report
- Variations Report
- Categories Report
- Coupons Report
- Taxes Report
- Downloads Report
- Stock Report
- Customers Report


**Customizable Dashboard**

WooCommerce Admin also allows store owners to customize a new dashboard screen with “performance indicators” that correspond in importance to their store’s operation.

1. Log in to your WordPress dashboard.
2. Go to: Plugins > Add New.
3. Enter “WooCommerce Admin” in the Search field, and view details about its point release, the rating and description.
4. Select “Install Now” when you’re ready.

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress Codex contains instructions at [Manual Plugin Installation](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
