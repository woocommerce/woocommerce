## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Check if session is set before returning updated customer address. ([8537](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8537))

1. Install [AvaTax](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-avatax/) (credentials in secret 7715) and set it up so taxes are applied to your orders. I used a store in the USA and used USA addresses.
2. Install WooCommerce Subscriptions
3. Create a Subscription product and add it to your cart. Then check out.
4. Open the **subscription** in the WP dashboard and from the subscription actions box choose "Process renewal"
5. <img width="319" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5656702/219742801-c2d87718-ddad-4622-a2b2-b9f7eb3befdf.png">
6. There is no error and the sum is correct.
