#### Fix: Load blocks style separately for classic themes [#10758](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10758)

0. Activate Storefront theme.
1. Create a post or page and add the All Products block. Verify styles are loaded correctly.
2. Visit the page in the frontend and verify styles are loaded correctly in the frontend as well.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with all blocks listed on [this page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/). Make sure to test each block individually. So, when possible, try with only one block on the page (in some cases, that's not possible, ie: filter blocks, in that case, try with as few blocks as possible on the page). The reason is that we want to make sure each block includes the style dependencies that it needs, so they need to be tested in isolation, otherwise styles from other blocks might leak into other blocks and "help fix issues".
4. Repeat steps above with a block themes. Block themes are excluded from the newly added logic so there shouldn't be any regression with blocks theme as well, but we should ,at least, smoke test with a block theme.

#### Adjust `Follow us on social media` pattern icon alignment [#10709](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10709)

1. Create a new post or page.
2. Insert the **Follow us on social media** Pattern.
3. Confirm the pattern is correctly displayed in the editor.
4. Save the post and head over to the front end and confirm the pattern is correctly displayed both on desktop and mobile view (the layout should match the one demonstrated in the above screenshots in the After column and in the screencast under the Updated section).
