## Feature plugin and package inclusion in WooCommerce

### Fix overriding archive-product when saving a fallback template ([7975](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7975))

1. Go to `Products` > `Attribute` (`/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=product&page=product_attributes`).
2. Edit one of the attributes (like `color`), check the `Enable archives?` checkbox, and save.
3. On the `Site Editor` (`/wp-admin/site-editor.php?postType=wp_template`), make sure you have no customizations on any template.
4. Edit the `Product Catalog` template, add some customization and save.
5. On the front end, go to `/shop` and make sure you see the customization you just did.
6. On the front end, go also to a category, a tag, and an attribute page (like `product-category/clothing/`, `/product-tag/music`, `color/red`, depending on your store configuration).
7. Check that all 3 pages are using the `Product Catalog` template, meaning you see exactly the same customization you did on the `Product Catalog`.
8. Go back to the `Site Editor`, click on one of the templates using the Catalog fallback (either `Products by Category`, `Products by Tag`, or `Products by Attribute`).
9. Make some customization and save it.
10. Go back to the `Site Editor` and make sure `Product Catalog` still has its original customization.
11. Make sure the other two templates still fall back to `Product Catalog`.
12. On the front end, go to `/shop` and make sure you see the `Product Catalog` customization.
13. On the front end, go also to a category, a tag, and an attribute page and make sure you see the expected customizations.

### Fix: Add non-ASCII terms support to Filter by Attribute block. ([7906](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7906))
