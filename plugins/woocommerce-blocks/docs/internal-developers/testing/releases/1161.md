## Testing Notes

### Add missing woocommerce classname to Classic Cart/Checkout Blocks container so UI updates when the cart is emptied. [#11919](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11919)

1. Edit the cart page
2. Convert the cart block into a "Classic Cart" block if not already there. You can use block transforms.
3. Save the page and go to the store.
4. Add some items to your cart, then head on to the cart page.
5. Remove each item from the cart using the X
6. The last item should be removed from the cart successfully. You can also "undo" the change and the item will come back.

### Fix an issue that caused the Order by select in Reviews blocks to always be disabled. [#11918](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11918)

2. Create a post or page and add the All Reviews, Reviews by Category and Reviews by Product blocks (in the last two, select the category/product which have reviews).
3. View the page in the frontend.
4. Verify it's possible to change the _Order by_ value and reviews are sorted accordingly.
