## WooCommerce Core

### Fix issue that prevented spaces being added to Mini Cart, Cart and Checkout buttons [#8777](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8777)

1. With Firefox, add the Cart block to a post or page.
2. In the editor, press the _Proceed to Checkout_ button to edit the text to something like: _Go to payment_ (or any string containing spaces).
3. Verify the text is updated correctly and spaces are added as expected.
4. Preview the page in the frontend and verify the button text is correct as well.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 with the Checkout and Mini Cart blocks. (For the Mini Cart, you will need to edit its template part)

### Fix Customer Account block doing a 404 request in the frontend [#8798](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/8798)

1. With a block theme like [TT3](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/), add the Customer Account block to the header of your site.
2. Go to the frontend and open the _Network_ tab in the browser devtools (<kbd>F12</kbd>).
3. Verify there is no request to `build/customer-account-frontend.js` which returns 404.
