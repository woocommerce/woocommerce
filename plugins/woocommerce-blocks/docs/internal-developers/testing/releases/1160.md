### Continue validating schema after validating nested properties [#11792](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11792)

This requires code, so this should only be tested by developers.

1.  Testing code:

Add this to functions.php or the main plugin file:

```php
woocommerce_store_api_register_endpoint_data(
	array(
		'endpoint'        => \Automattic\WooCommerce\StoreApi\Schemas\V1\CheckoutSchema::IDENTIFIER,
		'namespace'       => 'my-extension-test',
		'schema_callback' => function () {
			return [
				'my_field' => array(
					'description' => 'test 1',
					'type'        => 'string',
					'context'     => array( 'view', 'edit' ),
					'default'     => '',
				)
			];
		},
	)
);

woocommerce_store_api_register_endpoint_data(
	array(
		'endpoint'        => \Automattic\WooCommerce\StoreApi\Schemas\V1\CheckoutSchema::IDENTIFIER,
		'namespace'       => 'my-extension-test-2',
		'schema_callback' => function () {
			return [
				'my_field' => array(
					'description' => 'test 2',
					'type'        => 'string',
					'context'     => array( 'view', 'edit' ),
					'required'    => true,
				)
			];
		},
	)
);
```

This registers 2 additional schemas on the checkout route.

2. Try to place an order. You will get an error notice: `extensions > my-extension-test is not of type object.`
3. Open console and run this: `wp.data.dispatch( 'wc/store/checkout' ).__internalSetExtensionData( 'my-extension-test', { 'my_field': 'test' } );` This adds data for the first schema.
4. Place order again. **This time you'll see `extensions > my-extension-test-2 is not of type object.`**. This is what was fixed.
5. Open console and run this: `wp.data.dispatch( 'wc/store/checkout' ).__internalSetExtensionData( 'my-extension-test-2', { 'my_field': 'test' } );` This adds data for the second schema.
6. Place order again. It should go through successfully.

### Product Collection - New 'No Results' block with default UI [#11783](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11783)

#### Case 1: Normal

1. Create a new post & add Product Collection block
2. Verify that there is "No results" block, which UI should look like this:
   ![image](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/assets/16707866/6a52b7d6-1323-44f5-a71c-6dee5a6e0a97)


3. Save the post & verify on Frontend that "No results" blocks work as expected:
	- **Note:** This block will be only visible if there are no products to show on the frontend. You can achieve this by changing the filters in Inspector control such that there are no products to show for those filters. For example, try setting "Stock Status" filter to only "On backorder".
4. There are two links on frontend:
	- **store's home:** Verify that "store's home" link takes you to the home page of the store.
	- **clearing any filters:** This functionality is tested in Case 2.

#### Case 2: Testing `clearing any filters` link

1. Create a new post.
2. Add filters blocks, i.e. Filter by Price, Filter by Stock, Filter by Attribute, Filter by Rating, etc. You can use a pattern called "Product Filters" which contains all the filters.
3. Add Product Collection block & publish the post
4. Go to frontend:
	- Change all filter block values so that there are no products for selected filters and no results block becomes visible. URL will look something like this: `http://store.local/162-2/?filter_stock_status=instock&filter_color=blue%2Cgray&query_type_color=or&min_price=29&max_price=32`
	- Click on "clearing any filters" link & verify that it clears all filter values.
	- *TO BE TESTED BY DEVELOPERS*
		- You can also add some random query variables to URL, for example `&random=value` & URL will look something like this: `http://store.local/162-2/?filter_stock_status=instock&filter_color=blue%2Cgray&query_type_color=or&min_price=29&max_price=32&random=value`
			- Verify that clicking on `clearing any filters` only removes query variables that are related to filters & doesn't remove this random query variable we added.

#### Case 3: Adding styles to "No results" block

1. Create a new post & add Product Collection block.
2. Select "No results" block & change styles using Inspector control, i.e.:
	- Text, Background & Link color
	- Typography: Font family, appearance, line height, decoration etc.
3. Verify the changes made to these styles are visible on Editor.
4. Publish the post & verify that changes are visible on Frontend as well.

#### Case 4: Adding/removing blocks

1. Create a new post & add Product Collection block.
2. In “No results” block:
	1. Verify that you can remove existing blocks.
	2. Verify that you can add new blocks to it.
	3. Verify that the above changes are reflected correctly on the frontend.
