### Allow rendering HTML in shipping package names [7147](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7147)

#### Test HTML rendering in shipping package names

1. Install the [Multiple Packages for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/multiple-packages-for-woocommerce/) plugin.

3. Install the [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin.
4. Add the following code snippet to the site:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_shipping_package_name', 'test_package_name', 1, 3 );
function test_package_name( $title, $index, $package ) {
	return $title . '<br/>test<br/>test2';
}
```

5. Ensure to have one page with the Cart block and one page with the Checkout block.
6. Add two products to the cart.
7. Verify that the page with the Cart block shows the shipping package name with line breaks instead of showing `Shipping method<br/>test<br/>test2`.
8. Verify that the page with the Checkout block shows the shipping package name with line breaks instead of showing `Shipping method<br/>test<br/>test2`.
9. Replace the previous code snippet with the following one:

```php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_shipping_package_name', 'test_xss', 1, 3 );
function test_xss( $title, $index, $package ) {
    return $title . '<br><a href="https://woocommerce.com/" target="_blank">WooCommerce.com<img src=x onerror="&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041"></a>';
}
```

10. Verify that the page with the Cart block and the page with the Checkout block:

-   do not show an XSS alert.
-   do show the package name and the URL [WooCommerce.com](https://woocommerce.com/) in the next line and that the URL opens in a new tab when being clicked.

/>
```

to

```tsx
<div
	className="wc-block-components-shipping-rates-control__package-title"

	} ) }
/>
