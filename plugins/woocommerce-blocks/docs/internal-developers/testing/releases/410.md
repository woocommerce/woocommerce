### Fix Address Validation in the Store API and client

White space:
For the white space issue, it's easier to test without this PR first to see what happened, and then test it worked.

-   [ ] Add something to the cart.
-   [ ] Go to checkout.
-   [ ] Enter a space character in the postcode field.
-   [ ] See if it validates or not. Before this PR it does not—it allows checkout submission.

Validation via API
For validation, best to post to the API.

First add something to the cart via the API:

```sh
POST https://one.wordpress.test/wp-json/wc/store/cart/add-item
```

Body:

```json
{
	"id": 32,
	"quantity": 1
}
```

```sh
POST https://one.wordpress.test/wp-json/wc/store/checkout
```

Body:

```json
{
	"payment_method": "bacs",
	"billing_address": {
		"first_name": "Mike",
		"last_name": "Jolley",
		"address_1": "Test Address",
		"city": "Test City",
		"country": "US",
		"state": "AL",
		"postcode": "90210",
		"email": "test@test.com"
	},
	"shipping_address": {
		"first_name": "Mike",
		"last_name": "Jolley",
		"address_1": "Test Address",
		"city": "Test City",
		"country": "US",
		"state": "AL",
		"postcode": "90210"
	}
}
```

-   [ ] Leave out certain values to see validation errors. e.g. use an invalid email address, remove the state, enter an invalid state, use a non-existing country etc. Each will produce an error 400 and show a message.

Validation via Checkout

-   [ ] Also confirm checkout works as usual and this validation does not block. One thing you can do is checkout using a US address and enter a non-numeric zip code, e.g. ABC. You'll see error notices as the address updates and also if you try to place an order.

### Use em for coupon code button height

-   [ ] Set your browser font size to something smaller than 16px.
-   [ ] Open the Cart block and expand the Coupon Code panel.
-   [ ] Verify the button has the same height as the input text on the left.

### use ReplaceMediaFlow in featured category and feature product

-   [ ] Insert Featured Category and Featured Product
-   [ ] Try updating the image via media library or directly uploading.
-   [ ] There should be no console errors or warnings.
-   [ ] Your upload should work fine.

### Fix nonce issues when adding product to cart from All Products

-   [ ] In a private window, go to All Products, try to add to cart, it should work
-   [ ] Do it several times with several products.
-   [ ] Paginate the block and try to add products again.
-   [ ] If you have filters set up, try using filters and then adding to cart.
