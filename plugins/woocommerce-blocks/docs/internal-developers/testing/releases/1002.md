### Fix broken post/page editor screens in WordPress versions earlier than 6.2. [(9090)](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/9090)

1. Make sure your environment is WordPress 6.1.1
2. Ensure the Post, Page and Site editors load without issues.
3. Go to Appearance > Editor > Templates > Single Product and add the Product Image Gallery block somewhere on the page.
4. Without reloading the page, edit the Single template (or any other template unrelated to WooCommerce). Verify you can't add the Product Image Gallery block.
