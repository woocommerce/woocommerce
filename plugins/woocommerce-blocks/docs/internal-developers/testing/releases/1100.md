## WooCommerce Core

### Enhancements

#### Enable Product Collection as a core feature [#10524](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10524)

This PR enables a block that's been developed for a couple of months. Product Collection includes many functionalities and each of the changes at the moment of merging the particular functionalities. I don't think we should test ALL of them again, especially since the testing steps would be unreadable. However, I believe the major paths should be re-tested.

In some cases, I linked PRs. In that case, please refer to the testing scenarios from respective PR:

##### Major scenarios

###### Inserting

0. This PR should be tested in production build, so use `npm run build:deploy` if you test locally. Ignore this step when testing plugin as a whole.
1. Go to Editor
2. Type "Product Collection" and "Products (Beta)"
3. In both cases Product Collection (Beta) should appear in the inserter
4. Try to insert it
5. It should appear correctly in the Editor
6. Save and make sure it displays correctly in the Frontend

###### Inherit from query template

1. Open the Editor and navigate to the "Product Search Results"
2. Replace the existing 'Classic Template' block with the 'Product Collection' block.
3. After the 'Product Collection' block is successfully inserted, ensure that the 'Inherit query from template' option is enabled by default.
4. Save the changes.
5. Navigate to the frontend of your website. You can emulate a search for "shirt" by visiting the URL "/shop?s=shirt". Confirm that the search query `shirt` effectively displays related products.
6. Head back to the Editor.
7. In the 'Product Collection' block, deactivate the 'Inherit query from template' option.
8. Subsequently, you should observe various settings and filters available in the inspector controls. Modify these filters and settings as required and validate immediately that the changes are visible within the Editor.
9. Save your modifications and return to the frontend of your website.
10. Ensure that the adjustments made to the 'Product Collection' block within the Editor are accurately displayed on the frontend of your website.

###### Filters

1. Add Product Collection and Products (Beta) block side by side
2. Disable "Inherit query from template" in both
3. Set of filters should appear in the Inspector Controls
4. Play around with the filters setting up the same conditions in both cases (be aware Product Collection offers more filters than Products (Beta), so you may not be able to recreate all of the scenarios in Products (Beta) block)
5. Treat Products (Beta) block as a reference - the results in product grid should be the same in both cases. We look for discrepancies between blocks. Keep in mind in some scenarios filters may be mutually exclusive or there may be some existing bugs. If they occur in both blocks, feel free to report it but it's not a blocker to release Product Collection.

###### Global Styles

1. Add Product Collection and Products (Beta) block side by side
2. Play around with the Global Styles of Product Collection/Products, Product Template and particular Product Elements.
3. As in case of Filters we look for discrepancies between blocks. If there's bug that occur in both blocks, feel free to report it but it's not a blocker to release Product Collection.

###### Product Elements

1. Make sure you're able to add all of the following blocks in Product Template of Products Collection

- Product Image
- Product Title
- Product Price
- Product SKU
- Product Summary
- Product Rating
- Product Stock Indicator
- On sale badge
- Add to Cart Button

###### Others - play with it

1. Play with Product Collection as you would as a merchant. Test it, try to break it. Think of stuff we didn't think of and try it out!


#### Enable manual migration of Products to Product Collection [#10655](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/10655)

1. Go to Editor and add at least two Products (Beta) block
2. In one of them disable "Inherit query from template" and apply some advanced filters, for example, "Handpicked products"
3. Focus on either of the Products (Beta) block
4. Expected: There's an Upgrade Notice in Inspector Controls

5. Click "Upgrade to Product Collection"
6. Expected: all Products (Beta) blocks should be replaced with Product Collection blocks preserving the block settings (filters)
