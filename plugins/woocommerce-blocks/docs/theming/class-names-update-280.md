# Class names update in 2.8.0

In WC Blocks 2.8.0, some class names were updated in order to simplify them, fix inconsistencies, and make it easier to differentiate frontend components from editor components.

## Replaced classes

Some classes that were introduced in 2.6.0 and 2.7.0 and didn't ship in WooCommerce Core have been replaced by new ones. They can be found in this table:

| Removed | New class name |
| --- | --- |

## Deprecated classes

Some classes that were introduced in previous versions or that have shipped in WooCommerce Core, have not been removed but are deprecated. Those classes will not be removed yet but all themes are encouraged to update to the new ones:

| Deprecated | New class name |
| --- | --- |
| `wc-block-product-sort-select` | `wc-block-components-product-sort-select` |
| `wc-block-formatted-money-amount` | `wc-block-components-formatted-money-amount` |
