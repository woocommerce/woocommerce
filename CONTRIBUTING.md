# How to contribute

Community made patches, localisations, bug reports and contributions are always welcome and are crucial to ensure WooCommerce remains the #1 eCommerce platform for WordPress ;)

When contributing please ensure you follow the guidelines below so that we can keep on top of things.

__Note:__

GitHub is for *bug reports and contributions only* - if you have a support question or a request for a customization don't post here. Use [WooThemes Support](http://support.woothemes.com) for customer support, [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce) for community support, and for customisations we recommend one of the following services:

- [Codeable](https://codeable.io/)
- [Elto](https://www.elto.com/)
- [Affiliated Woo Workers](http://www.woothemes.com/affiliated-woo-workers/)

## Making Changes
