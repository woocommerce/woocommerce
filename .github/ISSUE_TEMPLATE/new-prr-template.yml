        Use this template to request changes to be included as part of a point release.
        **The request will be reviewed** and accepted or denied:
        
        * If accepted, please test your changes in against the release branch and merge.
        * If rejected, please change the base against `trunk` and merge it.
        
        In either case you are responsible for managing the pull request as usual (provide a description, assign reviewers, ensure that CI jobs pass...)

        ## Escape Analysis
        For the sake of expediting this request, the details below can be completed at a later time should you so choose.
        However, the Escape Analysis section is **required** for any accepted Point Release Request.
        In this section:
        * Think about how the bug escaped your team.
        * Write down ideas on how you could prevent this bug â€“ for example, by writing automated tests, creating a new process, or updating documentation.
        * Make a plan with your team to implement the changes proposed above in order to catch the bug earlier next time and add the related tasks to your backlog.
        * Please, add a separate comment that includes the details for the Escape Analysis. Together with this Escape Analysis, please make sure to include an actionable item that covers the gap exposed by this analysis. It could be a GitHub issue, the reference of a new item to discuss in a team meeting, etc. Anything that prevents this analysis from getting lost in P2 will be useful.
